<div data-label="532034">P-wave first-motion-derived focal mechanisms for template events which occurred during various phases of injection testing at Ngatamariki. Dark blue mechanisms in a and c occurred during stimulation of NM08, in the northern injection zone. Green mechanisms occurred during NM10 drilling losses and injection testing (panels b and d; southern zone). The symbols plotted in cross-sections c and d have been reprojected to reflect the different viewpoint (from the south). The inset figures in a and b show stress inversion results (lower hemisphere) from the focal mechanisms presented in northern and southern Ngatamariki, respectively, with red contours representing the probability density of the direction of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\sigma_1\)</span>, green representing&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\sigma_2\)</span> and blue representing&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\sigma_3\)</span> . The black dashed line indicates the direction of SHmax. In panel c, the red dashed line indicates the top of the intrusive sequence in northern Ngatamariki. As the extent of this unit is only constrained by core from wells NM04 (northeast of panel a), NM08 and NM09, its shape, volume and orientation are unknown.</div>
