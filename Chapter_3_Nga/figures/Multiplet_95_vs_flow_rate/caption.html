<div data-label="645772">Summary of seismicity and injection parameters during the cold-water stimulation of NM08. A) Cumulative seismicity vs. injectivity index, B) wellhead pressure vs. flow rate and C)&nbsp;Local magnitudes and available focal mechanisms solutions for the stimulation of NM08. Labels at the top of the plot delineate the following periods of interest: NF: near-field pressurization of the fracture zones surrounding the dike swarm, BT: breakthrough of pressurization from the near-well reservoir to the seismically-active fracture zone, FZ1 and FZ2: fracture zone pressurization and associated seismicity, RP: renewed pressurization of the near-well reservoir. Once the fracture zone pore-fluid pressure exceeds the maximum induced pressure during FZ1 (P<sub>T</sub>), seismicity is again induced. These periods are detailed in the schematic in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{740510}</span>.</div><div></div>
