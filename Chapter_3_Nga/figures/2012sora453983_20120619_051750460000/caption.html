<div data-label="971628">Example detections of two events by template 2012sora469246 (signal-to-noise ratio of ~50 and ~3 respectively). The 1 s templates (in red) are overlain on 10 s of continuous data around the time of detection (black). The M<sub>L</sub> 0.62 template event occurred on 22 June 2012 and detected mostly events that occurred during the stimulation of well NM08 between 6 June and early July. The detection on the left represents a detection of a separate, yet highly-similar, template event (template 2012sora469256) which occurred approximately ten minutes after the template event shown here. The detection on the right is a newly-detected event.</div><div></div>
