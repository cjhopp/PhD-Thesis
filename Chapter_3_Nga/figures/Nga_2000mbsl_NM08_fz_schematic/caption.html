<div data-label="111394">Schematic Mohr circles calculated for a depth of 2000 m bsl illustrating the effect of a) pore pressure increase and b) thermal cooling of the fracture zone near well NM08 (strike: 191<sup>o</sup>, dip: 66<sup>o</sup>). The natural state magnitude for&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\sigma_{1}\)</span> was determined by integrating density over depth using density values from well cuttings and core taken from NM08 (~45 MPa at 2000 ms). The magnitude of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\sigma_{3}\)</span> was extrapolated from leak-off tests conducted in Rotokawa (~29 MPa)&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{davidson_2012}</cite>. Reservoir pressure is approximately 22 MPa at 2000 m bsl. The failure envelopes represent cohesionless, preexisiting fractures with a coefficient of friction of 0.6. Circles in the figure represent the position of the plane defined by the hypocenters of seismicity during NM08 stimulation within each stress field. Plots are adapted from the output of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.geo.cornell.edu/geology/faculty/RWA/programs/mohrplotter.html" target="_blank">MohrPlotter</a>&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Allmendinger}</cite>.</div><div></div>
