<div data-label="740510">Schematic illustrating the sequence of events occurring at depth during NM08 stimulation. The headings of the inset panels correspond to the periods labeled at the top of Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{645772}</span>. The main permeable zone in well NM08 corresponds to a depth where the well intersects a mafic dike swarm. During NF, hydraulic conductivity between NM08 and the soon-to-be-active fracture zone was low. This period corresponds to a pressurization of the small, near-well fracture network hosted in and around a set of mafic dikes, hence the relatively high WHP but lack of seismicity. During BT, while WHP was below 2 MPa, a hydraulic connection was established with the fracture zone, consistent with increasing injectivity at the well. During FZ1, once WHP was increased to a steady 2 MPa, the pressure perturbation was able to diffuse into the fracture zone, weaken suitably oriented fractures and generate seismicity. At the start of phase two, the fracture network repressurized until it reached the maximum pressure encountered during phase one, at which point seismicity recommenced (FZ2).</div><div></div>
