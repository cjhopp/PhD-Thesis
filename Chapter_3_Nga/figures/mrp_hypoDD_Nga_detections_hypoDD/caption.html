<div data-label="827409">Relocated Ngatamariki seismic catalog for May 2012 through November of 2015 using the double-difference relocation method of&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Trugman_2017}</cite>. Production (red) and injection (blue) wells are shown with circles representing the wellhead and lines representing the surface projection of the wellbore at depth. In cross-section, the major feedzones in each injection well are shown as wide, blue rectangles. Events are colored by the date on which they occurred and scaled by their magnitude (M<sub>max&nbsp;</sub>= 3.1). Teal corresponds to the start of the dataset and pink to the end. Black triangles denote locations of seismic stations. The northern and southern portions of the field are divided by a dash-dotted line and labelled.</div><div></div>
