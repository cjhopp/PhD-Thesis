<div data-label="542095">All calculated focal mechanisms for Ngatamariki from May 2012 until November 2015. Grey polygons show the resistivity boundaries for Ngatamariki (to the north) and Rotokawa (to the south). Black lines indicate active faults from the GNS Active Fault Database (Langridge &gt;&gt;), red lines indicate production wells and blue lines indicate injection wells. Focal mechanisms are colored by the date of occurrence, with earlier events colored blue and later events colored pink. Focal mechanisms have been reprojected in each cross-section view to show "back-hemisphere" projections (i.e. the hemisphere "behind" the panel). Each cross section shows only the events within 1.5 km of the plane. Black triangles show the locations of seismic stations.</div>
