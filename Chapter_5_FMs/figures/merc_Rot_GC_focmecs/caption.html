<div data-label="817909">All calculated focal mechanisms for Rotokawa from May 2012 until November 2015. The grey polygon shows the resistivity boundaries for Rotokawa. Black lines indicate active faults from the GNS Active Fault Database (Langridge &gt;&gt;), red lines indicate production wells, blue lines indicate injection wells and the green line is a reservoir monitoring well. Focal mechanisms are colored by the date of occurrence, with earlier events colored blue and later events colored pink. Focal mechanisms have been reprojected in each cross-section view to show "back-hemisphere" projections (i.e. the hemisphere "behind" the panel). Each cross section shows only the events within 1.5 km of the plane. Black triangles show the locations of seismic stations.</div>
