<div data-label="425783">Adapted from Harris et al. (2006), showing the percentage energy capture by a subspace detector with increasing dimensionality. Gray lines show energy capture for each event in the design set used to construct the detector and the solid red line shows the average across all events. The dotted red lines indicate the dimension (n=9) corresponding to an average energy capture of 90%.</div>
