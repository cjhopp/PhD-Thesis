<div data-label="838185">Overview of the Rotokawa geothermal field. Injection wells are shown in blue, production wells in red with dots representing the wellhead and lines showing the surface projection of the wells at depth. Given the number of wells, names have been included only in the inset map. Active faults from the GNS Active Faults Database&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{AFDB}</cite> are shown in black. The most likely boundary of the deep resource as published by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Risk_2000}</cite> based on resistivity surveys, is shown in yellow. The surface projection of the three selected cross-sections in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{599670}</span> are shown for context.</div><div></div>
