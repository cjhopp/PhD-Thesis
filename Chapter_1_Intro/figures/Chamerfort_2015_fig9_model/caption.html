<div data-label="813462">Ngatamariki conceptual model proposed by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Boseley_2010}</cite> overlain on the geologic cross section in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{673646}</span> by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Chambefort_2016}</cite>. In this figure, green wells are injection wells and blue are production. Note that, for most figures in this work, blue wells will signify injection and red production. The main upflow at Ngatamariki is located between wells NM2 and NM3, in the northern part of the reservoir. Arrows indicate flow direction with the color signifying the relative temperature of the fluid (red=hot, blue=cold). Maroon lines are isotherms modeled from well temperature profiles.</div>
