<div data-label="182804">Typical 'r-t' plots from&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Shapiro_2002}</cite> showing the triggering front of seismicity as defined by SBRC for two injection operations: a) the Fenton Hill, New Mexico Hot Dry Rock experiment and b) the Soultz EGS project in France. Both sequences are well described by homogenous, isotropic triggering fronts.</div>
