<div data-label="621452">Schematic illustrating the changes in the Mohr circle induced by thermoelastic stress changes in a reservoir due to the injection of cold fluid, where the red circle represents the undisturbed state. The induced change in the reservoir stress state is dependent upon the direction of flow as it relates to the directions of the principal stress axes. Cooling preferentially decreases the magnitude of stress parallel to the direction of flow&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Jeanne_2014}</cite>. Therefore, the blue circle illustrates the effect of fluid flow parallel to&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\sigma_{3}\)</span>, thereby increasing the differential stress and bringing the fracture network closer to its critical stress state. If fluid flow is parallel to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\sigma_{1} \)</span>, then differential stress is decreased and the fracture network is made more stable. In the normal-faulting stress state of the TVZ (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\sigma_{1}\)</span> is vertical), the blue circle would correspond to a preferred NW-SE flow direction, whereas NE-SW flow would reduce&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\sigma_2\)</span> , a state which would be represented by a mohr circle equal in size to the red circle, but with modified sizes of the subcircles. This would signify a change in the orientation of fractures which would be able to fail. </div><div></div>
