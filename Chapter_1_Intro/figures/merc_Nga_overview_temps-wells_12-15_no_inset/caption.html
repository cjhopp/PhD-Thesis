<div data-label="425195">Overview of the Ngatamariki geothermal field. Injection wells are shown in blue, production wells in red with dots representing the wellhead and lines showing the surface projection of the well at depth. Wells NM04, NM08, NM05 and NM07 are near vertical and, therefore, appear only as dots in the figure.&nbsp; Active faults from the GNS Active Faults Database&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{AFDB}</cite> are shown in black. The most likely boundary of the deep resource as published by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Boseley_2010}</cite> based on magnetotelluric surveys, is shown in yellow.</div>
