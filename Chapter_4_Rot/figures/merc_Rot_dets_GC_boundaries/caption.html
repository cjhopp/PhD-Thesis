<div data-label="935417">Seismicity at Rotokawa from 2012-2015, relocated with GrowClust. The top panel shows seismicity as black circles, scaled to each earthquake's magnitude (as in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{349058}</span>). The bottom panel shows our interpretation of reservoir structure from the location of seismicity (red lines). These structures may define reservoir compartments (colored regions). The location and orientation of the Central Field Fault and Injection Field Fault (solid red) are well constrained from seismicity. In addition, the dotted red line indicates the location of a possible cross-strike structure north of the injection field, which may contribute to further injection-field compartmentalization.</div>
