<div data-label="518273">Overview of the Rotokawa geothermal field. The top right panel shows the location of the field on the North Island of New Zealand (yellow star). The top left panel shows the resistivity boundary of the field in yellow and injection and production wells in blue and red, respectively. Solid black lines are active faults. The lower panel shows a closeup of the field, with the well names labeled and the three known faults (PFF, CFF, IFF) shown as black dotted lines. The white dot-dashed line shows the extent of significant seismicity from 2008-2012, as reported by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Sherburn_2015}</cite>. There are four known compartments in the Rotokawa reservoir shown as colored polygons. Each is semi-isolated from the others by either a permeability contrast or impermeable barrier (i.e. a fault). The production field comprises three compartments, the west, central and north (green, blue and red, respectively). The injection field is shaded in purple and is a separate compartment.</div><div></div>
