<div data-label="108171">Seismicity in the western compartment defined above compared to well parameters for well RK24. The top panel shows the cumulative number of events (green dot-dashed) with injectivity at RK24 (blue). The middle panel shows the weekly rate of seismicity in the western compartment. The bottom panel shows both flow rate (dark gray) and wellhead pressure (yellow). Red shaded regions in all panels indicate the periods during which the power plants were shut down for maintenance, which have been recognized previously as periods of potentially heightened seismicity.</div><div></div>
