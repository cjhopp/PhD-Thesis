<div data-label="848333">Top panel: Frequency-magnitude distributions for the GNS (dotted) and matched-filter-detected (solid) catalogs at Rotokawa from 2012-2015. The calculated magnitude of completeness and b-value are noted in the top right for the matched-filter catalog. Bottom panel: Frequency-magnitude distributions compared for Northern Ngatamariki, Southern Ngatamariki and Rotokawa. The Mc and b-value for each catalog is noted in the top right, consistent with the catalog order in the legend.</div>
