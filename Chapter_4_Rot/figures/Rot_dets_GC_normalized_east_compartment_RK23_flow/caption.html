<div data-label="102850">Seismicity in the eastern compartments defined above compared to well parameters for well RK23. The top panel shows the cumulative number of events (magenta and coral colored lines) with injectivity at RK23 (blue). The middle two panels show the weekly rate of seismicity in the southeastern and northeastern compartments, respectively. The bottom panel shows both flow rate (blue) and wellhead pressure (green). Red shaded regions in all panels indicate the periods during which the power plants were shut down for maintenance, which have been recognized previously as periods of potentially heightened seismicity. The period of time during which RK23 was shut is shaded in gray.</div><div></div>
